<h1 mat-dialog-title>Components</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
  <strong>Verbal (V)</strong>
  <p>
    A verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component,
    you must be able to speak in a strong voice. A silence spell or a gag spoils
    the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened
    has a 20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component that he or she
    tries to cast.
  </p>
  <strong>Somatic (S)</strong>
  <p>
    A somatic component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must
    have at least one hand free to provide a somatic component.
  </p>
  <strong>Material (M)</strong>
  <p>
    A material component is one or more physical substances or objects that are
    annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is
    given for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don’t bother to keep
    track of material components with negligible cost. Assume you have all you
    need as long as you have your spell component pouch
  </p>
  <strong>Focus (F)</strong>
  <p>
    A focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a
    focus is not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with
    material components, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price is
    given. Assume that focus components of negligible cost are in your spell
    component pouch.
  </p>
  <strong>Divine Focus (DF)</strong>
  <p>
    A divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine
    focus for a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the
    character’s faith. If the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane
    version of the spell has a focus component or a material component (the
    abbreviation before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus
    component (the abbreviation after the slash).
  </p>
  <strong>XP Cost (XP)</strong>
  <p>
    Some powerful spells entail an experience point cost to you. No spell can
    restore the XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you
    lose a level, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to
    spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new level, use
    those XP for casting a spell rather than keeping them and advancing a level.
    The XP are treated just like a material component—expended when you cast the
    spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.
